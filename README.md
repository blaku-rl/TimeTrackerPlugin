# TimeTrackerPlugin
 
## Description

This plugin is made to track how much time you spend in each map. This is cool information to have especially for seeing how much time you've spent in different custom maps. You can sort the table by map name or time played and reverse each of the sorting methods.

## How It Works
The timer starts when the kickoff countdown starts (this is immediate in freeplay) and ends either when you leave the map or the podium at the end of the game is shown. Maps are identified by their package names, which aren't always the most accurate for what we commonly call them. I've included map names for the included maps in the game such as Beckwith Park and whatnot. You can overwrite all the names for maps by double clicking on it in the timer table. This will display a popup where you can edit the name to whatever you like.
